  Apple___Apple_scab: {
    symptoms:
      'A serious disease of apples and ornamental crabapples, apple scab (Venturia inaequalis) attacks both leaves and fruit. The fungal disease forms pale yellow or olive-green spots on the upper surface of leaves.',
    treatment: [
      'Choose resistant varieties when possible.',
      'Rake under trees and destroy infected leaves to reduce the number of fungal spores available to start the disease cycle over again next spring.',
      'Water in the evening or early morning hours (avoid overhead irrigation) to give the leaves time to dry out before infection can occur.',
      'Spread a 3- to 6-inch layer of compost under trees, keeping it away from the trunk, to cover soil and prevent splash dispersal of the fungal spores.',
      'For best control, spray liquid copper soap early, two weeks before symptoms normally appear. Alternatively, begin applications when disease first appears, and repeat at 7 to 10 day intervals up to blossom drop.',
      'Bonide® Sulfur Plant Fungicide, a finely ground wettable powder, is used in pre-blossom applications and must go on before rainy or spore discharge periods. Apply from pre-pink through cover (2 Tbsp/ gallon of water), or use in cover sprays up to the day of harvest.',
      'Organocide® Plant Doctor is an earth-friendly systemic fungicide that works its way through the entire plant to combat a large number of diseases on ornamentals, turf, fruit and more. Apply as a soil drench or foliar spray (3-4 tsp/ gallon of water) to prevent and attack fungal problems.',
      'Containing sulfur and pyrethrins, Bonide® Orchard Spray is a safe, one-hit concentrate for insect attacks and fungal problems. For best results, apply as a protective spray (2.5 oz/ gallon) early in the season. If disease, insects or wet weather are present, mix 5 oz in one gallon of water. Thoroughly spray all parts of the plant, especially new shoots.',
    ],

  Apple___Black_rot: {
    symptoms:
      'Early symptoms are often limited to leaf symptoms such as purple spots on upper leaf surfaces. As these spots age, the margins remain purple, but the centers dry out and turn yellow to brown. Over time, the spots expand and heavily infected leaves drop from the tree. Infected branches or limbs will show characteristic red-brown sunken areas that expand each year.',
    treatment: [
      'Treating black rot on apple trees starts with sanitation. Because fungal spores overwinter on fallen leaves, mummified fruits, dead bark, and cankers, it’s important to keep all the fallen debris and dead fruit cleaned up and away from the tree. ',
      'During the winter, check for red cankers and remove them by cutting them out or pruning away the affected limbs at least six inches (15 cm.) beyond the wound. Destroy all infected tissue immediately and keep a watchful eye out for new signs of infection.',
      'Once black rot disease is under control in your tree and you’re again harvesting healthy fruits, make sure to remove any injured or insect-invaded fruits to avoid re-infection. Although general-purpose fungicides, like copper-based sprays and lime sulfur, can be used to control black rot, nothing will improve apple black rot like removing all sources of spores.',
    ],
  },
  Apple___Cedar_apple_rust: {
    symptoms:
      'On apple and crab-apple trees, look for pale yellow pinhead sized spots on the upper surface of the leaves shortly after bloom. These gradually enlarge to bright orange-yellow spots which make the disease easy to identify. Orange spots may develop on the fruit as well. Heavily infected leaves may drop prematurely.',
    treatment: [
      'Choose resistant cultivars when available.',
      'Rake up and dispose of fallen leaves and other debris from under trees.',
      'Remove galls from infected junipers. In some cases, juniper plants should be removed entirely.',
      'Apply preventative, disease-fighting fungicides labeled for use on apples weekly, starting with bud break, to protect trees from spores being released by the juniper host. This occurs only once per year, so additional applications after this springtime spread are not necessary.',
      'On juniper, rust can be controlled by spraying plants with a copper solution (0.5 to 2.0 oz/ gallon of water) at least four times between late August and late October.',
      'Safely treat most fungal and bacterial diseases with SERENADE Garden. This broad spectrum bio-fungicide uses a patented strain of Bacillus subtilis that is registered for organic use. Best of all, SERENADE is completely non-toxic to honey bees and beneficial insects.',
      'Containing sulfur and pyrethrins, Bonide® Orchard Spray is a safe, one-hit concentrate for insect attacks and fungal problems. For best results, apply as a protective spray (2.5 oz/ gallon) early in the season. If disease, insects or wet weather are present, mix 5 oz in one gallon of water. Thoroughly spray all parts of the plant, especially new shoots.',

  Cherry_including_sour___Powdery_mildew: {
    symptoms:
      'Symptoms usually appear later in the growing season on outdoor plants. Powdery mildew starts on young leaves as raised blister-like areas that cause leaves to curl, exposing the lower leaf surface. Infected leaves become covered with a white to gray powdery growth, usually on the upper surface; unopened flower buds may be white with mildew and may never open. Leaves of severely infected plants turn brown and drop. The disease prefers young, succulent growth; mature leaves are usually not affected.',
    treatment: [
      'Plant resistant cultivars in sunny locations whenever possible.',
      'Prune or stake plants to improve air circulation. Make sure to disinfect your pruning tools (one part bleach to 4 parts water) after each cut.',
      'Remove diseased foliage from the plant and clean up fallen debris on the ground.',
      'Use a thick layer of mulch or organic compost to cover the soil after you have raked and cleaned it well. Mulch will prevent the disease spores from splashing back up onto the leaves.',
      'Milk sprays, made with 40% milk and 60% water, are an effective home remedy for use on a wide range of plants. For best results, spray plant leaves as a preventative measure every 10-14 days.',
      'Wash foliage occasionally to disrupt the daily spore-releasing cycle. Neem oil and PM Wash, used on a 7 day schedule, will prevent fungal attack on plants grown indoors.',
      'Water in the morning, so plants have a chance to dry during the day. Drip irrigation and soaker hoses will help keep the foliage dry.',
      'Use a slow-release, organic fertilizer on crops and avoid excess nitrogen. Soft, leafy, new growth is most susceptible.',
      'Destroy all plant debris after harvest (see Fall Garden Cleanup). Do NOT compost.',

  Corn_maize___Cercospora_Gray_leaf_spot: {
    symptoms:
      'Small necrotic (brown or tan) spots that may have a yellow chlorotic halo appear on lower leaves, usually before flowering. Gradually these lesions will turn grayish and appear on younger leaves, too. As the disease progresses, they enlarge into elongated, rectangular lesions that run parallel to the leaf veins. In optimal conditions (warm temperatures, high humidity and wet leaves), they can coalesce and engulf the whole leaf. If this happens before grain filling there can be considerable yield losses. The leaf blight can weaken the plants and sometimes soften the stalks, leading to lodging.',
    treatment: [
      'Plant resistant varieties if available in your area.',
      'Plant late to avoid adverse conditions for plants.',
      'Keep up good ventilation by widening the space between plants.',
      'Plow deep and bury all plant residues after harvest.',
      'Plan long-term crop rotations with non-host plants.',

      'A serious disease of apples and ornamental crabapples, apple scab (Venturia inaequalis) attacks both leaves and fruit. The fungal disease forms pale yellow or olive-green spots on the upper surface of leaves.',
    treatment: [
      'Choose resistant varieties when possible.',
      'Rake under trees and destroy infected leaves to reduce the number of fungal spores available to start the disease cycle over again next spring.',
      'Water in the evening or early morning hours (avoid overhead irrigation) to give the leaves time to dry out before infection can occur.',
      'Spread a 3- to 6-inch layer of compost under trees, keeping it away from the trunk, to cover soil and prevent splash dispersal of the fungal spores.',
      'For best control, spray liquid copper soap early, two weeks before symptoms normally appear. Alternatively, begin applications when disease first appears, and repeat at 7 to 10 day intervals up to blossom drop.',
      'Bonide® Sulfur Plant Fungicide, a finely ground wettable powder, is used in pre-blossom applications and must go on before rainy or spore discharge periods. Apply from pre-pink through cover (2 Tbsp/ gallon of water), or use in cover sprays up to the day of harvest.',

  Apple___Black_rot: {
    symptoms:
      'Early symptoms are often limited to leaf symptoms such as purple spots on upper leaf surfaces. As these spots age, the margins remain purple, but the centers dry out and turn yellow to brown. Over time, the spots expand and heavily infected leaves drop from the tree. Infected branches or limbs will show characteristic red-brown sunken areas that expand each year.',
    treatment: [
      'Treating black rot on apple trees starts with sanitation. Because fungal spores overwinter on fallen leaves, mummified fruits, dead bark, and cankers, it’s important to keep all the fallen debris and dead fruit cleaned up and away from the tree. ',
      'During the winter, check for red cankers and remove them by cutting them out or pruning away the affected limbs at least six inches (15 cm.) beyond the wound. Destroy all infected tissue immediately and keep a watchful eye out for new signs of infection.',
      'Once black rot disease is under control in your tree and you’re again harvesting healthy fruits, make sure to remove any injured or insect-invaded fruits to avoid re-infection. Although general-purpose fungicides, like copper-based sprays and lime sulfur, can be used to control black rot, nothing will improve apple black rot like removing all sources of spores.',

Powdery mildew starts on young leaves as raised blister-like areas that cause leaves to curl, exposing the lower leaf surface. Infected leaves become covered with a white to gray powdery growth, usually on the upper surface; unopened flower buds may be white with mildew and may never open. Leaves of severely infected plants turn brown and drop. The disease prefers young, succulent growth; mature leaves are usually not affected.',

      'Small necrotic (brown or tan) spots that may have a yellow chlorotic halo appear on lower leaves, usually before flowering. Gradually these lesions will turn grayish and appear on younger leaves, too. As the disease progresses, they enlarge into elongated, rectangular lesions that run parallel to the leaf veins. In optimal conditions (warm temperatures, high humidity and wet leaves), they can coalesce and engulf the whole leaf. If this happens before grain filling there can be considerable yield losses. The leaf blight can weaken the plants and sometimes soften the stalks, leading to lodging.',

These mainly elongated spots later turn into powdery, golden-brown pustules loosely scattered in patches on upper and lower sides. The color can change to black as the plant matures. Contrarily to other rust diseases, symptoms are not usually present on other plant parts, such as stalks, sheath leaves or husks. However, stalks tend to grow weak and soft and are prone to lodging. Younger leaf tissue is more susceptible to fungal infection than mature leaves. Plants infected during the early stages can show chlorosis of leaves and death, leading to high yield losses if upper leaves are affected.',
    treatment: [
      'No alternative treatment against Puccinia sorghi is available so far. Please get in touch with us in case you know of anything that might help to fight this disease. Looking forward to hearing from you.',
      'Always consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. The application of fungicides can be beneficial when used on susceptible varieties. Apply a foliar fungicide early in the season if rust is bound to spread rapidly due to the weather conditions. Numerous fungicides are available for rust control. Products containing mancozeb, pyraclostrobin, pyraclostrobin + metconazole, pyraclostrobin + fluxapyroxad, azoxystrobin + propiconazole, trifloxystrobin + prothioconazole can be used to control the disease. An example of treatment could be= Spraying of mancozeb @ 2.5 g/I as soon as pustules appear and repeat at 10 days interval till flowering. ',

  Corn_maize___Northern_Leaf_Blight: {
    symptoms:
      'There are several host-specific forms of E. turcicum. The most economically important host is corn, but other forms may infect sorghum, Johnson grass, or sudangrass.The most common diagnostic symptom of the disease on corn is cigar-shaped or elliptical necrotic gray-green lesions on the leaves that range from one to seven inches long.These lesions may first appear as narrow, tan streaks that run parallel to the leaf veins. Fully developed lesions typically have a sooty appearance during humid weather, as a result of spore (conidia) formation. As the disease progresses, the lesions grow together and create large areas of dead leaf tissue. The lesions found in Northern corn leaf blight are more acute if the leaves above the ear are infected during or soon after flowering of the plant.In susceptible corn hybrids, lesions are also found on the husk of ears or leaf sheaths. In partially resistant hybrids, these lesions tend to be smaller due to reduced spore formation. In highly resistant hybrids, the only visible disease symptoms may be minute yellow spots.',
    treatment: [
      'Crop rotation remains a solid tactic to help diminish disease threats. Rotating from corn to non-host crops helps reduce favorable environmental conditions for disease pathogens, risk of infection and disease levels. Any type of tillage that helps reduce crop residue from a previous corn crop will help manage northern corn leaf blight and other diseases overwintering in corn residue. Using a combination of management practices is particularly recommended in continuous corn grown with no-till and reduced tillage cropping systems, according to University of Illinois Extension.',
      'Foliar fungicides may be applied early in the growing season to corn seedlings as a risk-management tool for northern corn leaf blight and other corn diseases, including anthracnose leaf blight and corn eyespot. After northern corn leaf blight is identified during the growing season, fungicides should be applied early in the disease outbreak for maximum effectiveness.',

      'Leaf mold of tomato is caused by pathogen Passalora fulva. It is found throughout the world, predominantly on tomatoes grown where the relative humidity is high, particularly in plastic greenhouses. Occasionally, if conditions are just right, leaf mold of tomato can be a problem on field grown fruit. Symptoms start as pale green to yellowish spots on upper leaf surfaces that turn a bright yellow. The spots merge as the disease progresses and the foliage then dies. Infected leaves curl, wither, and often drop from the plant.Flowers, stems, and fruit may be infected, although usually only leaf tissue is affected. When the disease does manifest on the fruit, tomatoes with leaf mold become dark in color, leathery, and rot at the stem end.',
    treatment: [
      'The pathogen P. fulfa can survive on infected plant debris or in the soil, although the initial source of the disease is often infected seed. The disease is spread by rain and wind, on tools and clothing, and via insect activity.',
      'When planting, use only certified disease-free seed or treated seed. Remove and destroy all crop debris post-harvest. Sanitize the greenhouse between crop seasons. Use fans and avoid overhead watering to minimize leaf wetness. Also, stake and prune plants to increase ventilation.',

    treatment: [
      'Appearing as tiny, round splotches on the leaves, this tomato disease (Septoria lycopersici) typically starts on the lowest leaves first. The spots have dark brown edges and lighter centers, and there are usually many spots on each leaf. Infected leaves eventually turn yellow and then brown, and fall off.',

  Tomato___Late_blight: {
    symptoms:
      'Late blight (Phytophthora infestans) is among the most destructive tomato plant diseases. Thankfully, it’s not very common, especially in the north where it doesn’t survive winter’s freezing temperatures without a host plant. Late blight is caused by a fungus, and it creates irregularly shaped splotches that are slimy and water-soaked. Often, the splotches occur on the top-most leaves and stems first. Eventually, entire stems “rot” on the vine, turning black and slimy. There may also be patches of white spores on the leaf undersides. In the north, the pathogen overwinters in buried potato tubers. In the south, it easily survives the winter.',
    treatment: [
      'The spores of this disease are fast-spreading, moving on the wind for miles. If you live in the northern half of the continent, do not purchase potatoes and tomatoes that were grown in the south as you may inadvertently introduce late blight spores to your garden. This is not a common pathogen, but if late blight is reported in your area, there is little you can do to prevent the disease because the spores spread so rapidly. Plant only locally grown plants to help keep the pathogen out of your area.',

  Tomato___Early_blight: {
    symptoms:
      'This common tomato plant disease appears as bulls-eye-shaped brown spots on the lower leaves of a plant. Often the tissue around the spots will turn yellow. Eventually, infected leaves will fall off the plant. In most cases, the tomatoes will continue to ripen, even as the disease symptoms progress up the plant.',
    treatment: [
      'The early blight pathogen (Alternaria solani) lives in the soil and once a garden has shown signs of the early blight fungus, it’s there to stay because the organism easily overwinters in the soil, even in very cold climates. Fortunately, most tomatoes will continue to produce even with moderately severe cases of early blight. To prevent this tomato fungal disease, mulch plants with a layer of newspaper topped with untreated grass clippings, straw, leaf mold, or finished compost immediately after they are planted. This mulch forms a protective barrier, preventing the soil-dwelling spores from splashing up out of the soil and onto the plant.',

The lesions start as dark green spots and gradually shift to purple and eventually turn grey with black centers, sometimes with a white or yellowish outer ring. Bacterial spot symptoms also include thin and cracked leaf tissue and possible defoliation. The thinning and eventual disappearance of the leaves result in damaged and sun-scalded fruit. The spots that appear on the tomatoes themselves are small brown bumpy lesions that sink in as the fruit matures, making the fruit appear scabbed.',
    treatment: [
      'Once leaf spot has infected your plants, spray with copper fungicide for seven to 10 days.

      'Washing seeds for 40 minutes in diluted Clorox (two parts Clorox plus eight parts water) is effective in reducing the bacterial population on a seed’s surface. However, bacteria inside the seeds are little affected by this treatment.',
      'Seed treatment with hot water, soaking seeds for 30 minutes in water pre-heated to 125 F/51 C, is effective in reducing bacterial populations on the surface and inside the seeds. However, seed germination may be affected by heat treatment if not done accurately, while the risk is relatively low with bleach treatment.',
      'Control of bacterial spot on greenhouse transplants is an essential step for preventing the spread of the leaf spot bacteria in the field. Transplants should be inspected regularly to identify symptomatic seedlings. Transplants with symptoms may be removed and destroyed or treated with streptomycin, if detected at the very early stage of disease development. It should be noted that strains of leaf spot bacteria resistant to streptomycin may arise with multiple applications of streptomycin.',
      'Copper sprays can be used to control bacterial leaf spot, but they are not as effective when used alone on a continuous basis. Thus, combining these sprays with a plant resistance inducer, such as Regalia or Actigard, can provide good protection from the disease. Labeled rates of fixed copper is combined with different rates of Actigard, depending on the growth stage of plants. Higher rates (1 ounce per 100 gallons) of Actigard is used early in the season at transplant, 1/2 ounce is used two weeks later and 1/3 ounce is recommended for subsequent sprays as needed. Two other products, Penncozeb and Quintec were also found effective in some studies. However, organic growers should use copper and Regalia combination instead of copper and Actigard. Apply on a seven- to 10-day schedule; use the shorter interval when rain, high humidity and warm temperatures occur and the longer in case of dry weather.',
      'Beneficial microorganisms containing products, such as Serenade and Sonata, can reduce pepper leaf spot if used proactively. However, once the disease has spread to more than 5% of plants, these products can’t suppress the disease.',
      'Good cultural practices include avoiding all conditions that enable the pathogen to spread and multiply rapidly. Bacteria spread with splashing water. Therefore, overhead irrigation method should be replaced with drip irrigation and the field should not be accessed when plants are wet.',

  Grape___Black_rot: {
    symptoms:
      'elatively small, brown circular lesions develop on infected leaves and within a few days tiny black spherical fruiting bodies (pycnidia) protrude from them. Elongated black lesions on the petiole may eventually girdle these organs, causing the affected leaves to wilt. Shoot infection results in large black elliptical lesions. These lesions may contribute to breakage of shoots by wind, or in severe cases, may girdle and kill young shoots altogether. This fungus bides its time. Most plants show very little signs of infection until its too late. They will look very healthy until fruit sets. Even flowering will be normal.',
    treatment: [
      'Fungicides, applied early in the growing season, are a critical component of a black rot management program. The most effective spray program targets the period prior to bloom when spore production peaks. Fungicides should be sprayed during the period from early bloom through three to four weeks after bloom.',
      'The most common fungicides that prove to be excellent for certain regions of the United States for controlling black rot are Sovran 50WG, Flint 50WG, Abound Flowable (2.08F), and Pristine 38WDG. Some of these fungicides may only be available for commercial use, however homeowners may go to a hardware store or fungicide distributor for similar fungicides.',

  Peach___Bacterial_spot: {
    symptoms:
      'Numerous small spots form on the leaves. The spots are angular, purple to purplish-brown or black. Spots may merge and the centers may fall out, giving the characteristic “shothole” appearance. Heavily infected leaves turn yellow and drop. Severe leaf loss early in the summer reduces fruit size and weakens the tree. A few lesions can result in severe defoliation on sensitive varieties; tolerant varieties may require many more lesions for defoliation.',
    treatment: [
      'Bactericides are available for suppression of bacterial spot. Initial treatments focus on suppression of leaf infection and later on protection of fruit as they emerge from the shuck. Bactericide treatment may not be sufficient to eliminate symptoms under conditions very favorable for disease development',
      'Allow for good air circulation by avoiding low-lying orchard sites and by adhering to correct pruning practices. Prune during dry weather in the latter part of the dormant season.',

  Orange___Haunglongbing_Citrus_greening: {
    symptoms:
      'HLB is distinguished by the common symptoms of yellowing of the veins and adjacent tissues; followed by splotchy mottling of the entire leaf, premature defoliation, dieback of twigs, decay of feeder rootlets and lateral roots, and decline in vigor, ultimately followed by the death of the entire plant. Affected trees have stunted growth, bear multiple off-season flowers (most of which fall off), and produce small, irregularly shaped fruit with a thick, pale peel that remains green at the bottom and tastes very bitter.[5] Common symptoms can often be mistaken for nutrient deficiencies; however, the distinguishing factor between nutrient deficiencies is the pattern of symmetry. Nutrient deficiencies tend to be symmetrical along the leaf vein margin, while HLB has an asymmetrical yellowing around the vein. The most noticeable symptom of HLB is greening and stunting of the fruit, especially after ripening.',
    treatment: [
      'Some cultural practices can be effective in managing this disease. Cultural methods include antibacterial management, sanitation, removal of infected plants, frequent scouting, and most importantly, crisis declaration. Tracking the disease will help prevent further infection in other affected areas and help mitigate more local infections if detected early enough. The Asian citrus psyllid has alternative hosts that may attract psyllids to citrus plants in the vicinity such as Murraya paniculata, Severinia buxifolia, and other plants in the family Rutaceae',
      'No cure for citrus greening disease is known, and efforts to control it have been slow because infected citrus plants are difficult to maintain, regenerate, and study. Ongoing challenges associated with mitigating disease at the field-scale include seasonality of the phytopathogen (Candidatus Liberibacter spp.) and associated disease symptoms, limitations for therapeutics to contact the phytopathogen in planta, adverse impacts of broad-spectrum treatments on plant-beneficial microbiota, and potential implications on public and ecosystem health',

      'The young growing shoots are affected first. Disease infects leaves, shoots and berries. The symptoms appear as minute water soaked spots on the lower surface of the leaves along the main and lateral veins.Later on these spots coalesce and form larger patches. Brownish black lesions are formed onthe berries, which later become small and shriveled.',
    treatment: [
      'On leaf surface we will see lesions which are irregularly shaped (2 to 25 mm in diameter). Initially lesions are dull red to brown in color turn black later. If disease is severe this lesions may coalesce. On berries we can see symptom similar to black rot but the entire clusters will collapse.',

On berries we will see superficial spots and later may coalesce making berries appear black. Trunk/arm/cordons shows dark brown black vascular streaking and oozes dark sap when we cut trunk. Some time this measles in associate with numerous secondary wood rotting fungi which decorate the vineyard completely.',
    treatment: [
